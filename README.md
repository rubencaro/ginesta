Ginesta
=======

Ginesta is nothing more than a web frontend for those tasks that I, as a regular
git user, found myself doing with several tools at a time. It is written with
Ruby, and is built on top of Sinatra ( from https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra )
and uses Grit ( from https://github.com/mojombo/grit ) to work transparently
with git repositories.
